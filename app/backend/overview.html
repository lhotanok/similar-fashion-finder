<h1>Backend of a web application for searching fashion products by images ðŸ‘—ðŸ“·</h1>
<p>
    Similar Fashion Finder is a web-based tool for searching fashion products by images.<br>
    It is designed to help users find similar fashion products by uploading an image of a product they like.<br>
    The application uses several image hashing algorithms to compare the uploaded image with a database
    of fashion products.<br>The user can then view the similar products and purchase them online.
</p>
<p>
    The backend of the application consists of the following components:
    <ol>
    <li>
        <h2>Product Database</h2>
            A database of fashion products with image URLs and other metadata.<br>
            Each product is represented as a document in a MongoDB collection.<br>
            Each website has its own collection in the database, such as 'zalando-products' and 'zoot-products'.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Image Processing</h2>
        Images are extracted from product data, they are downloaded from remote URLs,<br>
        transformed (cropped to square and resized to a smaller size for more efficient processing)<br>
        and uploaded to the H2 database in form of hashes. There are several hashing algorithms used to hash
        the images:<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Difference Hash</li>
            <li>Perceptive Hash</li>
            <li>Wavelet Hash</li>
            <li>RotP Hash</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Image Search API</h2>
        An API that accepts an image URL, searches for similar images and uses those
        images to extract similar products from the MongoDB database.<br>Those products are then returned to the user
        along with the similarity score (distance and hamming distance) between the queried image and searched images.
    </li>
</ol>
